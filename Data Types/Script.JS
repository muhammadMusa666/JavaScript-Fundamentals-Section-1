// Also The Variable Should Be Above The Other Functions Etc,
// Because It Wont Work, And Below Is An Example, Since Let Year Is Not Defined,
// It Will Appear As Undefined In The Console, But The Same Variable Is Typed
// Below And Given The Value Of 1991, And It Will Appear Differently, Since That Has A Value,
// And It Has a console.log Below It, So Again It Prints Differenlty In The Console 
let year;
console.log(year);

console.log(typeof year);

// By The Way typeof has a Bug Or Error In It, When You Use null That Is,
// When You Do So It Javascript Returns It In The console Saying Its An "object",
// However This Is Not True And Should Return As null, But It Wasnt Fixed Due To Legacy Reasons ðŸ˜„
